Haunted Jaunt tutorial from Unity Learn
Explanation for using GIT: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpXxcvS-g3g
Few items to realize
1) On a Mac, version control is its own heading on Unity's Edit
2) .gitignore is hidden, find it using terminal, edit with vi
3) To remove slashes, edit the gitignore with vi
4) You must close Unity if you want to copy it to another location
5) You likely have to have Desktip Github open first??
6) Seems you have to open README with vi, not a native/purchased MAC app
7) You will likely need to PULL first (esp. if changes made on Server), otherwise "PULL" will be there (as a thing you need to do) before PUSH?
